## Projects I've worked on.

Flight simulator graphical interface. The STM32F407VE Black Board card was used for data acquisition while an EVK1105 evaluation card with LCD screen was used for visualization. A joystick was used to control the position of the engines, as well as an IMU to obtain the orientation of the aircraft. SPI, LCD, ADC, TIMERS, DMA

Implementation of a virtual dashboard for real-time monitoring of electric car systems and its instrumentation. The variables were proccesed with a ESP32 microcontroler and sent through WiFi
